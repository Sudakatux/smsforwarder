# CSV SMS to endpoint POST

This is just a sample app that listens to SMS parse them as CSV and makes a POST request to an api with
the different fields. The application will keep doing this even if you close it.

For doing this it uses workers. it also stores in a db the parsed message


This is an ongoing and currently working project so I had to strip out the real column names, field names and API
I haven't tested it since the name change but i have only changed the constant names and values.
